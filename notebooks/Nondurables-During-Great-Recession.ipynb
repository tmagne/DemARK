    "### There Was a Big Drop in Consumption ... \n",
    "Between the second and fourth quarters of 2018, nondurables consumption spending in the U.S. dropped by an unprecedented 6.4 percent.  High frequency data show a drop in retail sales of something like 10 percent between the weekend before the Lehmann collapse and the weekend after Lehmann.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ... and Uncertainty Could Induce A Drop In Consumption ...  \n",
    "Increased \"uncertainty\" has become a popular explanation of much of what happened in the Great Recession -- including this drop.  Qualitatively, it is well known that a perceived increase in labor income uncertainty should induce more saving (less consumption) for precautionary reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ... But Is the Story _Quantitatively_ Plausible?\n",
    "But if explaining a 6.4 percent drop in consumption would require an implausibly large increase in uncertainty, the story that uncertainty explains the consumption drop is implausible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitory Shocks, Permanent Shocks, or Unemployment\n",
    "The $\\texttt{ConsIndShockConsumerType}$ model incorporates three kinds of uncertainty: Unemployment spells, during which income is reduced to some small proportion of its normal level; and, for consumers who remain employed, transitory and permanent shocks with standard deviations $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ and $\\sigma_{\\psi}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question:\n",
    "How large an increase in the standard deviation of $\\sigma_{\\psi}$ would be necessary to induce a 6.4 percent drop in consumption in one quarter?  What about $\\sigma_{\\theta}$?  How high would the perceived unemployment probability have to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create the agents we want to solve the model for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model set up:\n",
    "- \"Standard\" infinite horizon consumption/savings model, with mortality and permanent and temporary shocks to income\n",
    "- Ex-ante heterogeneity in consumers' discount factors\n",
    "    \n",
    "With this basic setup, HARK's IndShockConsumerType is the appropriate subclass of $\\texttt{AgentType}$. So we need to prepare the parameters to create instances of that class.\n"

Some perspective on that question is offered by the large literature that attempts to estimate the magnitude of persistent or permanent shocks to household income.  The answer varies substantially across household types, countries, and time periods, but our sense of the literature is that the whole span of the territory between 0.04 and ranging nearly up to 0.20 is well populated (in the sense that substantial populations of people or countries have been estimated to experience shocks of this magnitude).\n",
